# IoT_lab_2
CSMA/CA and CSMA/CD simulation imlplemented with java Thread

# Start
start it, you will have to enter some parameters : Numbers of Hosts, Number of Packets to sent, the type of algo ('CSMA/CA' or 'CSMA/CD') And if your choice is CSMA/CD you have to enter the Delay parameter.

# CSMA/CD

The CSMA/CD use a collision system. it is a fast data transmission protocol, it's mainly used in ethernet structur. This patern can encounter collisions during transmission data.

# CSMA/CA

The CSMA/CA avoid collision system. it is less fast than CSMA/CD, it's mainly used in a wifi/Local structur.
